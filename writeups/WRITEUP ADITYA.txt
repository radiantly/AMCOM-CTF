Tale of Two Brothers (cryptography) - Hard - 350 points:

    Brief: Two loving brothers "Cryp" and "Ciph" made a deal. They found a pot of ANITMATTER in Netherland  and decided to hide it from the common people. Inorder to get the ANTIMATTER  both the brothers must be present. They exchanged messages to find their way back to the gold pot

	Cryp to Ciph = "In this year - '2020' we were seperated, not anymore. Solve my note to get ur secret phrase"
	Ciph to Cryp = "Brother, after serving in 'KRYPTON' I have decided to retire, my last word will be the end of times"

	Can you help the brothers to attain the ANTIMATTER ?
    
    Approach:
	1) first we need to decrypt the message, by reversing the expression
	2) then we need to find the corresponding prime number (999999999723511), this can be done by counting from largest 15 digit number
	3) the stopping critera is "AMCOM" for the first 5 digits
	4) when obtained the decrypted text we need to pass it to the cipher with a pass key (keyed vigenere ciphere [kryptos cipher])
	5)the decyphered text is used as the passphrase 
	6)the whole text gives us the flag

	FLAG : AMCOM{CryptoCipherMonatage}

	expression: 
	c = (a+b)*p

	p => prime number

	NOTE:
		-> Remember all flags starts with "AMCOM"
		-> The prime number is 15 digits
